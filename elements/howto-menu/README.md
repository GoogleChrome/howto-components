A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user,
such as a set of actions or functions. A menu is usually opened,
or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu
that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in
Windows, that opens a context specific menu.

The element that opens the menu is referenced with aria-labelledby.
